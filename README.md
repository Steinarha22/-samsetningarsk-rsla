## TÃ¶lvusamsetning
 When taking apart a computeer you have to be carful. Before you start you must make sure there is no statict around you like a blanket or a rug. Its
 also recommended for your computer to stand off the floor and that kinda is the name desktop. To make sure i wouldnt fry the motherbpoard i have a connector 
 on my wrist that connects to ground in my case i connected to the pc case before starting. The first thing i did was disconnect all the cables. I then started to take out the ram and then moved on to unscrewing the motherboard. After taking it out I disconnected the cpu fan and then took out the cpu and layed it on the table.
 I made sure i didnt touch any pins in the process and put the cpu on its front but cleaned it first and the cpu fan with paper. Its bedt to use alchoal vipes to get it all. I then unscreawd the power supply and after that everything was out exepct the Hard disk. Now it was to put everything back together. 
 I started by working on the motherboard. I apllied new thermal paste and put on the fan. I then put the ram inn. Now that the motherboard had all it needed i put it back in the case. and screwd it back together. Now the pc case had the motherboard i put inn the power supply. There are many ways you can put a pc together. You can plug inn all the cables inn first from the front of the pc like the connecter to turn it onn and off and also the hard disk. but i jist put my power supply stright away inn. I took all my cables from the power supply and placed it all on the other side before connecting so all the unwanted cables could stay there. i plugged all the front end connecters to the motherboard and then the power supply connectors. After it was all connected i turned it on before putting the side panals back on to make sure it works and it did.
